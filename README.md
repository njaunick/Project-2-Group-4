#Estimating Obesity Levels from Eating Habits and Physical Activity
 
**Overview**
This project aims to predict obesity levels based on individuals’ eating habits and physical activity using machine learning techniques. Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately estimate obesity levels, providing insights into the factors that contribute to obesity.

**Dataset**
*Source:* UCI Machine Learning Repository
*Name:* Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition
*Records:* 2,111 entries

**Project Components**
**Data Processing**
*Extraction and Cleaning:*
We used a Jupyter notebook to extract, clean, and transform the dataset. The cleaned data is saved as CSV files for further analysis.
*Exploration:* 
Initial data exploration to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.


**Model Development**
**Training and Evaluation**: 
A Python script was created to initialize, train, and evaluate our machine learning model. We aimed for a classification accuracy of at least 75% or an R-squared value of 0.80.
*Optimization:*
The model was iteratively optimized, with each change documented to show its impact on performance.
**Repository Management**
*Clean Structure:*
The GitHub repository is organized, with unnecessary files excluded using a .gitignore file.
*Documentation:* This README provides a polished overview of the project, and additional documentation is available within the repository.
